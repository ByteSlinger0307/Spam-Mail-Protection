# Spam Mail Protection Model

A machine learning project designed to classify emails as spam or non-spam based on various features. This model is built using Python and popular data science libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## Description

This project aims to utilize a supervised learning approach to identify spam emails based on input features like email content, sender details, and other relevant metadata. The model helps to filter out spam and enhances the accuracy of email classification systems.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ByteSlinger0307/Spam-Mail-Protection.git
    cd Spam_Mail_Protection_Model
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features that help in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Please ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to use the data if it is not included in this repository.

### Changing the Dataset Location
To use a dataset located in a different path on your system, modify the data loading section in the script or Jupyter notebook. Replace the default dataset path with your desired path as shown below:

```python
# Load the dataset
import pandas as pd

# Change the path to your dataset location
data_path = "path/to/your/dataset.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)
```

## Model
The model uses features from email metadata and content to classify emails as spam or non-spam. Various machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated to select the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Steps Involved

The project follows a systematic approach to build a reliable diabetes prediction model. Below are the detailed steps involved:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gathered a dataset containing various features indicative of spam or legitimate emails.
   - 
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values and cleaned the data by removing unnecessary characters or content.
   - Normalized and scaled the features to ensure consistent model training.
   - Encoded categorical variables to numerical values for compatibility with machine learning models.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.
   - Visualized the data using histograms, word clouds, and correlation plots.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - Applied techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance to select the most relevant features for model training.

5. **Model Selection:**
   - Experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.
   - Implemented these algorithms using Python libraries such as scikit-learn.

6. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
   - Trained the models using the training dataset and tuned parameters to optimize performance.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score.
   - Compared the performance of different models to select the best one.
     
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to improve model performance.

9. **Model Deployment (Optional):**
   - Considered deployment options such as using Flask for creating an API or Docker for containerization.

10. **Documentation and Reporting:**
    - Documented the process, including data handling, model evaluation, and final selection.
    - Created visualizations and reports to summarize the findings.
      
11. **Future Work:**
    - Potential improvements include experimenting with more algorithms, incorporating additional data, or enhancing feature engineering.

These steps ensure that the model is built systematically with a strong foundation in both data handling and machine learning practices.

## Usage
To run the model, use the provided Jupyter notebook or execute the script directly if provided. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the correct path as required by the script or notebook.

## Evaluation

The performance of the spam classification model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The overall percentage of correctly classified emails.
- **Precision:** Measures how many of the predicted spam emails are actually spam.
- **Recall:** Indicates how well the model identifies actual spam emails.
- **F1 Score:** A balance between precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **ROC-AUC Score:** Assesses the model’s ability to differentiate between spam and non-spam classes.

A confusion matrix was used to visualize the model’s performance, highlighting true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

The models were also evaluated using K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure consistent performance across different subsets of the data, helping to prevent overfitting.

Overall, the model that balanced these metrics best was selected as the final model for spam email classification.
